Dichloromethane (100 ml) was layered slowly onto solid triformylbenzene (TFB, 5 g, 30.86 mmol) without stirring at room temperature. 1Trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added directly to this solution as a catalyst for the imine bond formation. Finally, a solution of (R,R ) -1,2-diaminocyclohexane (5 g, 44.64 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to this, again without mixing. The reaction was covered and left to stand. The absence of stirring is important since it controls the dissolution rate of the TFB: similar results can be obtained by slow addition, for example with syringe pump, although the layering method is convenient, reproducible, and scalable to multigram quantities. Over 5 days, all of the solid triformylbenzene was used up and octahedral crystals of 3-R grew on the sides of the glass reaction vessel. The crystalline product was removed by filtration and washed with 95 % ethanol / 5 % dichloromethane. Yield 6.5 g, 83 %.|triformylbenzene|None|(R,R ) -1,2-diaminocyclohexane|None

After tri(4-formylp henyl)amine (264 mg, 0.8 mmol) was charged into the flask, dichloromethane (100 mL) was added. The clear yellow-green solution that was formed was kept for the next step. To another oven-dried flask, also cooled to room temperature under N 2, was added (1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine dihydrocholoride (208 mg, 1.2 mmol), methanol (100 mL), and triethylamine (243 mg, 2.4 mmol). The clear, colorless solution was stirred at room temperature for 5 C10 min. This solution was then added very slowly to the first solution by pouring gently down the side of the flask to form two layers: a colorless layer on the top and a yellow-green layer at the bottom. A cloudy interface appeared between these two layers as the reaction progressed. The resulting suspension was then sealed and kept at room temperature for 7 days. A white solid which adhered to the walls of the flask was observed after 7 days, along with a clear yellow supernatant solution. The white solid was collected by filtration and washed with DCM (3 × 5 mL) to afford pure cage 5 in 90% yield (305 mg).|tri(4-formylp henyl)amine|None|(1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine dihydrocholoride|None

The formation of 2a was characterized by both NMR spectroscopy (Figure S11, S12, S13, S14), mass spectrometry (Figure S15) and single crystallography (see Figure 3A in the main text). Specifically, the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S11) proved the presence of CH{{{羽 interaction, i.e., see the discussion in the main text. The peak assignment was made based on two-dimensional NMR spectra, including COSY (Figure S13) and NOESY (Figure S14). 1H NMR diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments (Figure S16) demonstrate that 2a was produced as a relatively pure compound. | 1a | Compound S1 (200 mg) and compound S2 (184.6 mg) were dissolved in Et3N (30 mL) under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen.

The CHCl3 phase was dried using anhydrous MgSO4 before being removed under vacuum. RCC3 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1 %) was obtained as a white solid. RCC3 was purified by using the reversible reaction with acetone. In a 250 mL flask, 1000 mg crude RCC3 was dissolved in acetone (100 mL). The solution was covered and left to stand.
